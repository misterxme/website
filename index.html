                        **I am MisterX and I write things**

Welcome to my words
===============================================================================

# Why are we here?

A question pondered by many, if not all humans at some point in time. It's funny, I recall being pretty young and thinking of this very thing. I could have been maybe eight or ten years of age and I remember starring at the sky. (I like to claim I have a semi eidetic memory, and it only works some percentage of the time, but I remember the " snapshot" of me on this day).

I walked on our back porch past the elephant ear plants that I would often piss on in the monring (my dad would get pissed at me when he would see my watering efforts) and I would ponder. At the time, I would have been shuttled to a Baptist church at some regular interval each week, and the teachings there discussed the maker of everything. And then I would ask, but who created them, and my mind would melt into a fractal loop of the creaqtor of the creator of the creator...

# I masturbate

I kinda do it more than I'd like to right now. It doesn't mean it's a high amount of times each day, but it's more than I prefer. It's become a daily ritual that allows me to think properly. When I'm feeling sad or anxious, it's a relief to that. When I need a shot of energy, I can go rub one out. It's become a multi purpose tool that I don't want to abuse. Because it wears out quickly and if you over indulge, it loses its effectiveness.

My compulsive desire to slap the ham comes about usually, when there is some sort of chaos in my life. It often starts small, going from a healthy sexual relationship with myself to something I feel like I cannot stop at times, without having a wave of anxiety poking me every few seconds. I observe my reasoning if I should do it or not and while I have that debate, I'm usually in the process of pulling out my penis and giving it a wank. Of course I lose this battle each time and I just go for it. 

My worst is when I wake up to my self touching myself or I'm asleep apparently, and my wife walks into the room and I just start masturbating. I feel embarrassed, she says she's used to it and doesn't care.

There are also other times where I finish and then I "come to my senses" (the dopamine surge) and I immediately regret it. When I'm doing it, I'm in a trance and it's one of those things that feels too good in the moment to stop. I'm often aware of each of these dynamics as they unfold in the moment, but I lack the discipline to walk away. I feel bad afterwards, but at the same time I still have that relief I needed. So it's not all bad. 

Depending on my hyper-sexuality level for the day, my compulsive conquest become more promiscuous and impulsive. That song "Jizz in my Pants" by Lonely Island does a great explanation of this, with the scene where a cold breeze blows in and he Jizzes in his Pants. I almost feel that sensitive at times, happily going about my day and then something brushes against my penis and I have to have a go at it. 

Panties have been my thing recently, smelling the crotch area and licking them when there is residue (you don't want to lick the smell out if there's nothing there). I stalk my wife's dirty underwear, leggings and anything I know might have that scent and if I walk by a room and see some "fresh" ones, I am compelled to do the deed. 

> *(**Intermission to beat it**)*

And now I feel like I can think a bit better. I tried describing the trigger and it triggered me, so that kinda goes to show the issue. I'm probably due a break for a bit if i cannot ease it back into a healthy state. I don't like doing it just to do it. I don't like feeling like I need to in order to function. I don't like how it depletes, and gets harder and harder to achieve after multiple times in a short period (I think just yesterday, there was a 10 minute lull between me finishing and getting triggered by something, though i still got it in on this round as well). I just want to be well regulated and not have the need to do something every-time I'm feeling down.

# I miss my friend

I used to have this friend. They were like a drug to me. Intoxicating to be around, never a dull moment. They kept me on my toes, brought me into uncomfortable situations and made me feel at peace. That's a hard thing to influence with a single variable. 

I hurt that same person, many times. And they made me hurt at times. And yet all this time later, I can only think of the good. The positive overwhelms whatever it was that made us do that to each other then. 

This person has always been that one person, that no matter what, there was always this underlying connection and understanding between each other. We would go on to date others, only to visit each other in passing and maintaining that bond. We would check in on each other and piss off the other's boyfriend/girlfriend. We would say we love or missed each other, and not speak for years at a time.

I miss my friend

# Dream Tyme

I don't dream often to the point of remembering them, likely because of the pot smoking. But on occasion, I'm able to recall something very very vividly and capture it down in much less words than describe what took place. For me when I read them, I'm taken back to the dream as if it were a memory and I see pictures of what took place. 

#### Dream 1

I witnessed one of my dad's old work trucks (big box truck) try to turn onto a street and the top got hit by a tree. I just so happened to be walking/car riding by when that happened.

#### Dream 2

Justin offered to take me to the pawn shop to get my laptop so i didn't have to leave it over night.  It seems my car was there and laptop inside of it. I wasn't very responsive to him or something and it was almost night time before I decide to take him up on the offer. 

#### Dream 3

I was in a field with Justin I think and we were meeting up with some people. They were frisking us and checking for guns. The third person we met, the person I was with decided to shoot on them. I was standing next to the other guys and dove to the right as they began to shoot.

#### Dream 4

I met the perfect woman in my dreams last night. I don't have a face, it was purely someone that made me feel at peace. It was easy to be around them and I just wanted to kiss them. I was sitting at a table speaking with them and then another person saw us, and I had to run after them. I didn't know how to get in touch with her, or if I'd ever see her again. But I felt at peace and knew deep down, everything was okay.

#### Dream 5

Had another dream where i was getting money from an ATM and someone tried to rob me. When I saw them pull I, I began to roll my window up and stalled them by singing/making noises. They pulled a gun on me, but I just pulled away.

#### Dream 6

It was a very short dream. I was in a room with a bunk bed and Eugene walked in holding Jackson with my mom. He didn't claim to be Eugene and was there to help with the baby. I walked out of the room with my mom and she shortly colapse to the ground after hearing bad news over the phone. I assumed my grandmother had died and then got confused and thought it might be about a dog. After I walked past her, I was alone and took a seat in a cafe. It's covid and I didn't have my mask on and I noticed the waitress was aproaching me from 30 feet away or so. To avoid speaking with her about why I didn't have my mask, I remembered that I was dreaming and woke myself up.

---

This dream took place after a night of mostly full rest and then taking a "nap" at 6AM until everyone else woke up

# What is happy

Happy to me is being in a place where I get up and I'm excited for the day. I might have planned out the night before, and I am ready to move. I cook breakfast in the morning, I do the few dishes that need to be done, I feed the kid, I stretch, I journal and I have a semi-regular routine when I awake. After that, I don't really care how good or bad work goes. It's nice to be accomplished there, but in the end I'm most happy when things at home are good. I suppose one thing I care about, is being able to leave on time. 

After work, I want to spend time with my child and wife and cook dinner. Any minor chores that are needing done I do. A happy time is one where it doesn't felt like I'm putting effort and trying hard just to get through. Before baby, I would rarely microwave my dinner or breakfast. Now I do it so frequently, I forget how good home made food each night is.

Exercise is a large key to the success of happiness. We need to be mobile and remain mobile into our older years. If we aren't mobile, that will eventually become the norm. It's important to establish good habits and routines that improve who you are and how you navigate through life.

To me, happy is just being and not having a worry. Happy is letting go, and trying out new adventure. Happy is a place I long for. Happy is so close, yet so far. Happy, happy.

# Opiate Research

https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/opiate-addiction/related-topics/opiates-and-anxiety/

> While the analgesic [effects of opiates](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/opiate-addiction/side-effects/) can address mental as well as physical discomfort, opiates can also trigger anxiety as quickly as they can alleviate it. People with anxiety disorders who use opiates may experience a worsening of anxiety symptoms over time as levels of key brain chemicals drop and may even develop dependence and addiction.

- Unfortunately, using opioids to alleviate anxiety comes with many negative consequences, including a higher risk of addiction, overdose, medical complications, social and legal problems, and worsened anxiety symptoms

- [Opiate withdrawal symptoms](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/opiate-addiction/withdrawal-detox/) are notoriously unpleasant and can include hot flashes, muscle cramps, tremor, nausea and vomiting. Among psychological effects, opiate withdrawal anxiety is especially common.
- There are several symptoms that can be experienced during post-acute withdrawal. Not everyone will experience all of them, and they often come and go. Symptoms include:
  - Aggressive behavior
  - Cravings
  - Anxiety
  - Mood swings
  - Depression
  - Fatigue
  - Insomnia
  - Inability to focus
  - Low libido
  - Memory lapses
  - Suicidal thoughts
- While acute withdrawal symptoms generally resolve in a few weeks, PAWS symptoms can last for a few months or up to a year.

# I'm tired

I can't work a full-time job and take care of a developing child. It breaks my heart when i cannot give him my full attention and he deserves it. When you are too tired to help, that's understandable here and there. It can't be everyday though. You have to stay up a few hours and take a nap when he does. 

I feel like the fact that I have to work from home has put us in a situation where you depend on me to a point it's become a detriment to you. If I was in the office during work hours, you would have no choice but to handle your shit. I'm used as a crutch and we are beyond the point of reasonableness with how the duties are shared. There are days in a row where I don't get the help I need, all the whilst you are taking drugs, smoking cigarettes and in a place that you cannot "help". 

It's easier for me to not depend on you than to have hope you're going to do what you say. And maybe that's my fault for not pestering you more, but I don't feel like I should have to. When I hear you are going to do this and you'll take care of him and it never happens, it just further my trust in things you say. And then when I try to ask if you're going to be able to help, you get flustered and put your emotions onto me to the point that I'd rather not even ask. And again, i shouldn't have to ask for help with our child and me working.

At this point, all I want is to have him taken care of for the 9 hours I work minus a lunch break. I shouldn't have to multi-task in the way that i am and it's not fair. All I want to do is take care of that man but it is not my role to do that and work a full time job. And while it feels like that's what i'm doing, my attention is diverted so constantly I'm not being effective in attending to him and also my job responsibilities.

I don't play games anymore. I don't watch video game matches or really get consumed in things the way I did before. I don't buy things for myself. I don't have time to shower when I want, cook, or just go to the store to grab something. I can't just go work out when I want. I don't wake up and say I'm tired and I'm going to go sleep in another room. If I'm not feeling well, I can't just try again another day. I push through because I have to, because that living being depends on us. And while I give you the opportunity to many of these things, It's been taken advantage and it doesn't feel fair when it happens this much.

I'm tired of our lives revolving around this and I sure as fuck am not going to waste what little time we have here, going over the same arguments over and over again. We should be a team trying to accomplish goals instead of constantly working against one another. I love you unconditionally and it pains me that as the supplier of the money that buys you drugs, I can't be strong enough to say no to you. I let you walk all over me when it comes to money and how you spend it and i'm just too fucking tired to argue anymore. This has been ongoing for years and I've shed too many tears for this to affect me any longer. I just let it happen. I'm numb to it. You don't listen to me or act like you care. You are compelled to do what you do and there is nothing  I can say or do that shows me you are listening.

You wonder why we live paycheck to paycheck, even though we get 5K a month and our bills are only about have of that. I sure as shit am not buying anything to show for where that money is going and I happily hand it all over for you to spend on drugs. I've tried saving money for years now, and somehow if we have the money you find a way to spend it. I hide money when I can, only to find it stolen whilst i'm sleeping. I got to the point that I would have nightmares about my wallet missing and you buying drugs in the middle of the night, because half the time it was happening. And then we pretend you didn't steal any money. And then it's this one last time. And then I'm not being reasonable. And then it wasn't that long ago. And then we fight about your drug usage, which is not my fucking problem. You should never fight with me for me saying no to giving you money but we do and then you manipulate the situation into me giving in. Even if that means we can't pay our bills, hence the living paycheck to paycheck.

And even though I make enough money, you steal from your parents too. Let them live out their life without someone siphoning the money they rely on to live each month. We likely bring in more money than they do and don't need them to be impacted by your compulsions. And lies about how we need money or some other fictitious situation that came up unexpected.
