                        **I am MisterX and I write things**

Welcome to my words
===============================================================================

# Why are we here?

A question pondered by many, if not all humans at some point in time. It's funny, I recall being pretty young and thinking of this very thing. I could have been maybe eight or ten years of age and I remember starring at the sky. (I like to claim I have a semi eidetic memory, and it only works some percentage of the time, but I remember the " snapshot" of me on this day).

I walked on our back porch past the elephant ear plants that I would often piss on in the monring (my dad would get pissed at me when he would see my watering efforts) and I would ponder. At the time, I would have been shuttled to a Baptist church at some regular interval each week, and the teachings there discussed the maker of everything. And then I would ask, but who created them, and my mind would melt into a fractal loop of the creaqtor of the creator of the creator...

# I masturbate

I kinda do it more than I'd like to right now. It doesn't mean it's a high amount of times each day, but it's more than I prefer. It's become a daily ritual that allows me to think properly. When I'm feeling sad or anxious, it's a relief to that. When I need a shot of energy, I can go rub one out. It's become a multi purpose tool that I don't want to abuse. Because it wears out quickly and if you over indulge, it loses its effectiveness.

My compulsive desire to slap the ham comes about usually, when there is some sort of chaos in my life. It often starts small, going from a healthy sexual relationship with myself to something I feel like I cannot stop at times, without having a wave of anxiety poking me every few seconds. I observe my reasoning if I should do it or not and while I have that debate, I'm usually in the process of pulling out my penis and giving it a wank. Of course I lose this battle each time and I just go for it. 

My worst is when I wake up to my self touching myself or I'm asleep apparently, and my wife walks into the room and I just start masturbating. I feel embarrassed, she says she's used to it and doesn't care.

There are also other times where I finish and then I "come to my senses" (the dopamine surge) and I immediately regret it. When I'm doing it, I'm in a trance and it's one of those things that feels too good in the moment to stop. I'm often aware of each of these dynamics as they unfold in the moment, but I lack the discipline to walk away. I feel bad afterwards, but at the same time I still have that relief I needed. So it's not all bad. 

Depending on my hyper-sexuality level for the day, my compulsive conquest become more promiscuous and impulsive. That song "Jizz in my Pants" by Lonely Island does a great explanation of this, with the scene where a cold breeze blows in and he Jizzes in his Pants. I almost feel that sensitive at times, happily going about my day and then something brushes against my penis and I have to have a go at it. 

Panties have been my thing recently, smelling the crotch area and licking them when there is residue (you don't want to lick the smell out if there's nothing there). I stalk my wife's dirty underwear, leggings and anything I know might have that scent and if I walk by a room and see some "fresh" ones, I am compelled to do the deed. 

> *(**Intermission to beat it**)*

And now I feel like I can think a bit better. I tried describing the trigger and it triggered me, so that kinda goes to show the issue. I'm probably due a break for a bit if i cannot ease it back into a healthy state. I don't like doing it just to do it. I don't like feeling like I need to in order to function. I don't like how it depletes, and gets harder and harder to achieve after multiple times in a short period (I think just yesterday, there was a 10 minute lull between me finishing and getting triggered by something, though i still got it in on this round as well). I just want to be well regulated and not have the need to do something every-time I'm feeling down.
