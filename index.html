                        **I am MisterX and I write things**

Welcome to my words
===============================================================================

# Why are we here?

A question pondered by many, if not all humans at some point in time. It's funny, I recall being pretty young and thinking of this very thing. I could have been maybe eight or ten years of age and I remember starring at the sky. (I like to claim I have a semi eidetic memory, and it only works some percentage of the time, but I remember the " snapshot" of me on this day).

I walked on our back porch past the elephant ear plants that I would often piss on in the monring (my dad would get pissed at me when he would see my watering efforts) and I would ponder. At the time, I would have been shuttled to a Baptist church at some regular interval each week, and the teachings there discussed the maker of everything. And then I would ask, but who created them, and my mind would melt into a fractal loop of the creaqtor of the creator of the creator...
